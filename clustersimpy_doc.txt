CLUSTERSIMPY latest version: 1.0

Description: 

Clustersimpy is a program to make, and write stellar clusters with planetary systems to a file for simulations. This code allows for some customization of cluster distrbution (current customizability is descibed below), velocity distrbution, energy balance and mass distribution. 

Fuctions avalible in clustersimpy:


**** gen_cluster(x) ****

x must be an list of the following parameters: x = [Rmax, N, q, a, b, c, sigma]
Rmax - maximum radius of the cluster (descibed it size, maybe smaller than this if fractal)
N - number of star you want to populate your cluster
q - energy balance (virial equilibrium q = 0.5)
a,b,c - fractal box dimentions (ideeally square but not strict)

funcitions callable in gen_cluster(x):

	**** gen_position(disrtibution,D=1) ****
	the distribution can be either "Uniform" or "Fractal"
	D is by default 1 and represents the fractal dimension of the fractal substucture so is only 
	useful for "Fractal". 
		

**** get_planet(x) ****



**** measure(data) ****



**** data(filename) ****
